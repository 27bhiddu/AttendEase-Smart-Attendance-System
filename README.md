# AttendEase-Smart-Attendance-System
AttendEase: Smart Attendance System – Flutter mobile app + PHP web panels (admin/student) with Directus/MySQL backend in Docker. Teachers mark theory/lab attendance w/ images; students track reports via email login. Secure, scalable, error-free alternative to manual methods. 
AttendEase: Smart Attendance System digitizes attendance management for educational institutions using Flutter for mobile apps, PHP for web panels, Directus/MySQL backend in Docker.  It supports role-based access with teacher registration/approval, student email login, image-based marking for theory/lab classes, and detailed reports. 

## Core Features
- Teachers create sessions for multiple classes, mark attendance with images, distinguishing theory/lab types.
- Students view class-wise/subject-wise percentages, track shortages (e.g., below 75%), by date/month/year. 
- Admins manage users, students, classes, branches, semesters; generate defaulter reports. 
## Technical Architecture
Flutter app and PHP panels share Directus APIs on MySQL; Docker ensures consistent deployment.  Role-based security, real-time data sync, scalable for multi-branch use.

## Team and Development
Developed collaboratively: Mayank Rawal (Flutter app, Directus/Docker backend), Baby Kunwar (PHP admin/student panels).  Focuses on usability, error reduction over manual methods.
